# Python War
This is a really simple game of War made with python, where the computer just runs a simulation to find out how many turns it takes for a random deck and a player to win. Only about 100 lines of code, but thats why the game War is fun, it's extremly simple, yet you can have turns from as little as 8 to as many as 1000.
